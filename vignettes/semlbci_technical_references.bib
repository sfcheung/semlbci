	abstract = {There are three common types of confidence interval ({CI}) in structural equation modeling ({SEM}): Wald-type {CI}, bootstrapping {CI}, and likelihood-based {CI} ({LBCI}). {LBCI} has the following advantages: (1) it has better coverage probabilities and Type I error rate compared to Wald-type {CI} when the sample size is finite; (2) it correctly tests the null hypothesis of a parameter based on likelihood ratio chi-square difference test; (3) it is less computationally intensive than bootstrapping {CI}; and (4) it is invariant to transformations. However, {LBCI} is not available in many popular {SEM} software packages. We developed an R package, semlbci, for forming {LBCI} for parameters in models fitted by lavaan, a popular open-source {SEM} package, such that researchers have more options in forming {CIs} for parameters in {SEM}. The package supports both unstandardized and standardized estimates, derived parameters such as indirect effect, multisample models, and the robust {LBCI} proposed by Falk.},

	abstract = {We extend to score, Wald and difference test statistics the scaled and adjusted corrections to goodness-of-fit test statistics developed in Satorra and Bentler (1988a,b). The theory is framed in the general context of multisample analysis of moment structures, under general conditions on the distribution of observable variables. Computational issues, as well as the relation of the scaled and corrected statistics to the asymptotic robust ones, is discussed. A Monte Carlo study illustrates the comparative performance in finite samples of corrected score test statistics.},

	abstract = {When the multivariate normality assumption is violated in structural equation modeling, a leading remedy involves estimation via normal theory maximum likelihood with robust corrections to standard errors. We propose that this approach might not be best for forming confidence intervals for quantities with sampling distributions that are slow to approach normality, or for functions of model parameters. We implement and study a robust analog to likelihood-based confidence intervals based on inverting the robust chi-square difference test of Satorra (2000). We compare robust standard errors and the robust likelihood-based approach versus resampling methods in confirmatory factor analysis (Studies 1 \& 2) and mediation analysis models (Study 3) for both single parameters and functions of model parameters, and under a variety of nonnormal data generation conditions. The percentile bootstrap emerged as the method with the best calibrated coverage rates and should be preferred if resampling is possible, followed ...},
