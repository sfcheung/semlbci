# semlbci 0.0.0.8

- Updated the vignette.

# semlbci 0.0.0.7

- Added diagnostic info to the output.

# semlbci 0.0.0.6

* Added functions to implement the Neale-Miller 1992 approach. Preliminary tests passed. Can be invoked by `method = "nm"`.

# semlbci 0.0.0.4

* Can find the LBCI for the free and user-defined parameters in the standardized solution.

* Starting values based on Wald CIs are uesd also for standardized solution.

# semlbci 0.0.0.3

* Can find the LBCI for free parameters and user-defined parameters.

* Work for models with equality constraints.

* Can specify parameters by lavaan model syntax.

* Can use Wald CI to set the starting values. The optimization is usually faster.

# semlbci 0.0.0.1

* A first rough draft of the functions.
